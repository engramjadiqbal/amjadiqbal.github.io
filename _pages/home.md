Hi, there! I'm Dr. Muhammad Amjad Iqbal. I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Eratothenes Centre of Excellence (ECoE) within the [Marine Safety and Security Cluster](https://eratosthenes.org.cy/departments/resilient-society-department/). My research focuses on remote sensing, including SAR/ISAR and optical data processing, polarimetry, CFAR-based target detection, Doppler analysis, and ocean current estimation. Also focuses on high-resolution imaging using sparse data, extending to mm-wave radar imaging, feature extraction from back-scattering, and fast target imaging in an inverse SAR setup using compressive sensing.

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. from the Faculty of [Electronics, Telecommunications, and Information Technology](http://www.electronica.pub.ro/) at the [University Politechnica Bucharest](https://upb.ro/en/), working with Prof. Andrei Anghel and [Prof. Mihai Datcu](http://ceospacetech.pub.ro/index.php/ceospacetech-members/10-members/84-members-mihai-datcu) as a member of the [CEOSpace Tech.](http://ceospacetech.pub.ro/) lab. 
I specialized in the field of 2D radar imaging, compressive sensing, Ocean Remote sensing, and Earth Observation. My primary area of research revolves around developing innovative methods for signal and image processing for target detection and features extraction.


During my P.h.D. i wokred as an Early-stage Researcher (ESR) in the European Training Network (ETN) H2020-MSCA-ITN [MENELAOS-NT](https://www.menelaos-nt.eu/) project. The project applies Novel Technologies to realize multimodal â€“ multi-sensor data fusion to optimally combine the information delivered by different sensors (in-situ/remote, optical/non-optical) on different scales, with different resolutions, and with different reliability.

As a part of my work, I published several papers in top-tier conferences and peer-review journals in the field of remote sensing and radar imaging.

I have obtained my B.S. degree in Electrical (Telecommunication) Engineering from Government College University Faisalabad, Pakistan, and M.S. degree in Communication and Information System Engineering from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China. Finally, I received Ph.D. degree from the University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania, in Electronic Engineering, Telecommunications, and Technology Information (summa cum laude) in 2024.

I thoroughly enjoy collaborating with interdisciplinary teams encompassing diverse backgrounds. My experience encompasses working alongside small, agile teams to deliver problem-oriented and dependable software solutions. As a Computer Vision engineer, I highly value proactivity, knowledge sharing, and adherence to sound coding practices.

Please take a look at [some of my work](/work).
